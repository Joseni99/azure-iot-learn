# Farewell

As our Azure lab journey comes to an end, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your active participation and enthusiasm throughout the duration of these labs.

Before we bid adieu to our Azure playground, I'd like to remind everyone to ensure that all resources are properly closed and any lingering services are deactivated. As a reminder, your accounts were provided with free credits to explore Azure services, and it's crucial to close everything to avoid incurring additional costs beyond the allocated credits.

Here are a few steps to ensure a smooth closure:

1. **Resource Cleanup**: Take a moment to review all the resources you've provisioned during the lab. Identify and delete any unnecessary virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, etc. that are no longer needed.

2. **Deactivation of Services**: Double-check to ensure that all Azure services and resources are turned off or deleted. This includes pausing or deallocating virtual machines, stopping databases, and disabling any other active services.

3. **Billing and Cost Management**: Monitor your Azure billing dashboard to ensure that there are no unexpected charges accruing. If necessary, set up billing alerts to receive notifications if usage approaches the free credit limit.

Thank you once again for your active participation and collaboration. It has been a pleasure guiding you through this Azure journey. Should you have any questions or require assistance with the closure process, feel free to reach out to me directly.

Wishing you continued success in all your Azure endeavors!

Warm regards
